            <h2>Geography and History</h2>

            <p>Seattle is located 90 miles east of the Pacific Ocean, 113 miles south of the Canadian border, and sits along Elliott Bay in the Puget Sound. The city is 
            surrounded by the Cascade Mountain Range to the east and the Olympic Mountains to the west. Seattle’s summers are often dry with daily high temperatures in 
            the mid 70s while the fall, winter, and spring seasons are wetter and cooler with frequent rain.</p>

            <p>Seattle officially became an incorporated city in 1869 even though Washington did not officially become a U.S. state until 1889. Early industries including 
            lumber, coal, fishing, and shipbuilding plus the nearby terminus of the transcontinental railroad led to population growth in the 1880s. The city experienced 
            ups and downs in the 1890s including a devastating fire and economic depression, but the discovery of gold to the city’s north in 1897 and expanded railway 
            systems in the early 1900s cemented Seattle’s position as a shipping and trade center.</p>

            <p>Seattle continued to grow in the early 1900s in both population and construction, including the L.C. Smith building which was the tallest building in the 
            American west for four decades. Seattle's shipbuilding industry also expanded, producing 20% of the nation’s wartime ships during World War I. Like much of 
            the nation, the 1930s depression was hard on Seattle, but the city rebounded in 1942 when ships were once again needed for World War II.</p>

            <p>In <a href="https://www.seattle.gov/cityarchives/exhibits-and-education/digital-document-libraries/century-21-worlds-fair">1962 Seattle hosted the 
            World’s Fair</a> which allowed the city to <a href="https://www.seattlecenter.com/about/history">greatly expand the Seattle Center</a> and other attractions, 
            hotels, and venues which are still popular today.</p>

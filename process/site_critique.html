	<h4>Navigation</h4>
	<p>The site has two navigation bars.
	Depending on which option you have selected for the upper menu, different options are displayed for the lower menu.
	The upper menu has options for the different reasons/occasions someone may be visiting Savannah, while the lower menu leads to drop-down sub-menus for the things a traveler might be interested in, such as things to do and places to stay.
	</p>
		
	<h4>Usability</h4>
	<p>The two navigation bars are slightly confusing, but the drop down menus in the lower navigation bar have the content you would expect.
	The feature boxes on the main page have visual effects when you hover over them, which is a good indication that they act as links.
	There is a "plan your visit" section lower on the page that allows you to input dates and number of guests and click "search" to find suitable hotels, but it isn't super clear that the dates and number of guests fields are interactable.
	Below that there is an interactive map that does highlight and zoom sections when you hover over them, which is nice.
	</p>
	
	<h4>Typography and hierarchy</h4>
	<p>Savannah is a southern historic city, and the serif font the site uses in headers/titles for sections fit this well. 
	The actual paragraphs use a sans-serif font, which is more clean and readable. 
	The headers are also larger than the main text and use different colors in most instances.
	</p>
	
	<h4>Overall style/look and feel</h4>
	<p>The website's design carries the charm of Savannah as a city without feeling messy or overcrowded.
	I personally think purple is a bit of an odd choice for a main color, but it could definitely be worse.
	I also appreciate how the footer has more style than footers typically do.
